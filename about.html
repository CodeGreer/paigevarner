            <h2>Hello, I'm Paige.</h2><p class="smaller_font">My pronouns are she, her, hers.</p>
            
            <img class="about_me" alt="A head shot of Paige Varner, certified labor doula." src="images/doula-paige-cappa.png">
            
            <p> Several years ago I accompanied a friend during her birthing process. Immediately, I felt at home. Supporting her labor felt natural, powerful, and fulfilling. Over the next few years I continued to provide labor support to the occasional friend. These wonderful people told me I had provided a calm presence, comfort, and support. A bud of an idea nestled in the back of my mind eventually flourishing into a calling: to become a professional doula.</p> 

            <p>Throughout my adult life I have studied spiritual practices and meditation techniques. This path complements my formal education: a lifetime ago, I received my master's degree in physics from The College of William &#38; Mary in Virginia. Working with various forms of meditation gives me intuitive tools to balance my logical, scientific training. I embrace both! My technical background helps me gather and present information to expecting parents about their birthing options. At the same time, the more intuitive, experiential work leads me to see pregnancy and birth as a rite of passage. I feel called to support this deeply significant transition.</p> 
            <p>My own baby is now a young teen, and my own dream of being a doula is a reality. I am a Certified Labor Doula through CAPPA <a class="more underline" href="http://www.cappa.net/">(www.cappa.net)</a>. I typically support one to two client births a month.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>I'm Jo.</h2>
            <p class="smaller_font">My pronouns are they, them, theirs.</p>
            <img class="about_me" alt="A head shot of Jo Benshoof, doula." src="images/doula-jo.png">
            
            <p>My journey to discover my doula calling began many years ago. I have always been drawn to the nurturing side of ministry and spirituality. During a friend’s pregnancy several years ago, I had my first taste of a different form of ministry through the Birth Blessing ceremony that I co-led. The focus on my friend, and what she might need to fulfill her personal and motherhood needs, resonated fully with me as a form of nurturing I had never thought of. In college, while taking a class focused on the sociology of birth and parenthood, I decided to interview Paige about her process of becoming a professional doula. Her story and the interview were all I could talk about for weeks — which should have been a sign. But it wasn’t until my last semester in college, when Paige asked if I would join her and become a doula myself, that I realized how much passion I had for supporting those who are going through the powerful experience of bringing children into this world.</p>
            
            <p>I have studied spirituality and ministry, feminism and gender, and Meditation-Based Cognitive Therapy, finding where many pieces of these fields interconnect. Recently, I graduated from Georgia State University with my BA in Creative Writing and minors in Women’s Sexuality and Gender Studies and Psychology. Being a doula uses all three parts of my degree, and fulfills my callings towards ministry and art. I am blessed and honored to be on this journey, and to assist those choosing to give birth as a significant part of their life journeys.</p>
