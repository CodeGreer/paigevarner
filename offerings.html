            <p>My vision is to create a safe space for you and your partner to relax into as you welcome your new baby into the world. I support your choices and hopes for your birth. I encourage you to plan the labor that feels right for you – and then I step in to support your plans.</p>

            <h3 class="full_width">Birth Care</h3>

            <p>Birth Care encompasses at least one prenatal visit, support during your labor and delivery, and one postpartum visit.</p>

            <p class="service_offered">Prenatal Visit<br>
            Time: 1 to 2 hours</p>

            <p>The prenatal visit begins our journey as you, your partner, and I get to know each other. We'll meet at your home or another agreed-on location: wherever you're most comfortable. I want to hear your hopes, dreams and (even) fears about giving birth (or, in your partner's case, "co-piloting" a birth). We'll talk about all that I can provide as a doula to support you emotionally and physically.</p> 

            <p>With your permission, we'll explore your spiritual beliefs and practices and how I can best support your deeper wisdom &#8212; allowing it to bring the most energy and comfort to you. And we'll talk about your interest in being guided through visualization and meditation to nurture you through stressful moments.</p>

            <p>I'll also reassure your partner that supporting them through the birthing process is every bit as important as nurturing you.</p> 

            <p>Along with sharing all that a doula can provide, I'll detail which lines doulas don't cross. As we end our prenatal visit, my hope is the you will both feel a lovely combination of being excited and tranquil about this unparalleled journey you've begun.</p>

            <p class="service_offered">During Birth</p>

            <p>As your birthing companion, I will be in frequent communication with you via email, text, and phone during the last weeks of your pregnancy. At the prenatal visit we’ll talk about the details of when I will join you when your labor begins.</p>

            <p>During labor, I will be at your side assisting you in turning inward, listening to your body, and engaging in your process. I’ll provide emotional comfort, physical support, massage, position-change suggestions, guided meditation, breathing reminders, and simple presence &#8212; sometimes just knowing you’re not alone brings the right comfort at the right time. My goal is to support your goals in a manner that is comfortable to you.</p>

            <p>For your partner my support involves reassuring them that your experience is normal. I will provide in-the-moment suggestions for ways that your partner can support you and stay actively involved in your birth experience. Sometimes a partner needs a sounding board: someone to bounce ideas off of as forks-in-the-road decisions present themselves. I'm happy to listen and make suggestions, but the decision ultimately comes from you and your partner.</p> 

            <p class="service_offered">After the Birth<br>
                Time: An hour or under</p>

            <p>I will stay with you up to an hour after your baby is born to assure that you, your partner, and your baby are comfortable and ready for family alone-time.</p>

            <p class="service_offered">Our Last Visit<br>
                Time: one to two hours</p>

            <p>At our last visit, I will get to meet your precious new baby, hear how things are going, and review your birthing experience. This is a time when we can process all aspects of your birth experience. I can also assist you in locating any resources you may need at this time, from a specialist to help with breastfeeding challenges, to a great photographer for infant portraits.</p><br>


            <p><span class="bold">Total Birth Care Fee: $350-$750</span>, depending on your location, hospital, and the specifics of your situation.</p>

                <p class="bold_title">Birth Blessing</p>

                <p>The Birth Blessing is a supportive ceremony for you to experience about two to three weeks before giving birth. The Birth Blessing welcomes you into the circle of those who have given birth through the ages. You'll invite close friends and family members to join us as you, and your journey, are honored. During your labor, you can draw on the energy of this ceremony to remember both our ancestors who made this journey and the many people who love and support you. You’ll leave this ceremony with a special touchstone piece that will be with you during your birthing experience &#8212; and through your life.</p>

                <p class="bold_title">Belly Cast</p>

                <p>This unique piece of art will fill your home and hearts for years to come. I will gently layer strips of plaster gauze over your stomach to create a cast. The process, including drying for removal, takes about an hour. Once the finished cast has thoroughly dried over a few days, you have options. You can leave it plain or decorate with paint and craft materials. Or, you and I can work together to decorate it in a manner that honors your deep wisdom and your pregnancy journey. Or, you can leave it unpainted for a few years, and wait until your baby has reached the desired age so they can share in painting the very cradle where they began.</p>
